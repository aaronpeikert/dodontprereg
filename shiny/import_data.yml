  details: Clear and comprehensive information is crucial in pre-registration as it
    allows future collaborators, reviewers, and replicators to understand the methodology,
    rationale, and intended analyses, ensuring transparency and reproducibility. By
    specifying all details—such as hypotheses, sample size, procedures, and data analysis
    plans—you minimize ambiguities and prevent retrospective alterations, thereby

  details: Specifying how you will evaluate model fit in your pre-registration is
    crucial for ensuring transparency and reproducibility in your research. By detailing
    the exact criteria and metrics, such as AIC, BIC, or RMSEA, you minimize the risk
    of biased post-hoc adjustments and provide a clear framework for others to understand
    and replicate your results. This level of detail also helps in safeguarding against

  details: Specifying model fit cutoffs in your pre-registration is crucial because
    it sets clear, a priori standards for evaluating the adequacy of your model. This
    transparency helps prevent post-hoc justifications and increases the credibility
    of your findings. Using techniques like the McNeish-Wolfe approach provides a
    robust framework for establishing these cutoffs based on empirical data, ensuring
    that your criteria are well-supported and scientifically valid.

  details: Pre-registering confirmatory hypotheses assumes that researchers are making
    predictions without advanced insight into the data. If you are already familiar
    with the dataset, it can compromise the objectivity and validity of the pre-registration,
    reducing its credibility. In such cases, consider pre-registering exploratory
    analyses instead, or acknowledge the potential bias and detail the sources of
    your prior knowledge within the pre-registration.

  details: Pre-registration compels researchers to carefully plan and document their
    study design, hypotheses, and analysis methods in advance, reducing the risk of
    data-driven decisions that could compromise the validity of the results. By doing
    so, it not only enhances the transparency of the research process but also strengthens
    the integrity and reliability of the findings, as every step is premeditated rather

  details: Reducing researcher degrees of freedom is crucial in pre-registration because
    it minimizes the potential for data-driven decisions that can lead to biased outcomes.
    This can be done by clearly specifying hypotheses, analysis plans, and data collection
    methods in advance, ensuring that the research follows a predetermined path rather
    than being influenced by the data as it is analyzed.

  title: Understand the implications of the complexity of your design. (example may

  - - During prereg-prep
    - Conceptual consideration
  details: Understanding the complexity of your design is crucial for a precise pre-registration
    that can accurately inform your data analysis plan. Complex designs, such as longitudinal
    studies or multi-factorial experiments, often require detailed specifications
    of interactions and multiple variables, which can lead to an increased risk of
    ambiguous hypotheses and analytical flexibility. Being clear about the complexities
    involved helps ensure that your pre-registration is comprehensive and specific,
    minimizing subjective decision-making that can bias the results. For example,
    pre-registering a multi-condition experiment will necessitate detailed descriptions
    of each condition, the relationships between them, and your specific analysis
    plan for each possible outcome.

  details: Updating or submitting a new preregistration when substantive changes occur
    ensures transparency and accountability in the research process. This practice
    helps to avoid the appearance of 'p-hacking' or data fishing by documenting any
    shifts in methodology or analysis before examining outcomes, thereby maintaining
    the integrity and credibility of the research.

    encourages you to be meticulous and transparent in your pre-registration documentation.
    This mindset ensures that the details are comprehensive and clear, making it easier
    for others (and yourself) to understand, evaluate, and recreate the study, thus
    enhancing the credibility and reliability of your research findings.

  details: In time-constrained situations, prioritizing key aspects of pre-registration
    such as specifying hypotheses, key variables, and primary analyses ensures that
    even brief pre-registrations can protect against questionable research practices.
    This focused approach allows for transparency and accountability, which are the
    core purposes of pre-registration, even when comprehensive documentation is not
    feasible.
